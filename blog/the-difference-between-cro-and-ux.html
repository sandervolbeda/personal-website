            <p>During the time I worked at <a href="https://parkos.com/" rel="nofollow">Parkos</a> my job was to do CRO, but function also included some UX components. I was curious about the differences, so I did some research.</p>
            <p>Here is an quick overview where this article is about.</p>

                <p>To get a better understanding of what CRO and UX are I’ve defined both job descriptions here.</p>
                
                <h3>What is UX?</h3>
                <p>UX stands for User Experience. This means in short how a person experiences a product or service. The ‘experience’ consists of various facets like design, copy, interaction, usability, accessibility and information architecture (layout and structure of website or app). The focus with UX is on users while keeping the business KPIs in mind.</p>
                <p>UX is intended to make your website easier to use, to navigate around, and to take key actions on. UX refers to an overlapping segment of disciplines and research that study how easy a website is to use. Usability, as it pertains to the web, is the degree to which a site can be utilized by a particular demographic to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>What is CRO?</h3>
                <p>CRO is from a business perspective, but also has input for the users. CRO is created to reduce the costs of ads (SEA). This means you buy less traffic on your website. To achieve this you need to be smarter in how to convert these users. In short, the ratio of conversions needs to go up.</p>
                <p>CRO is intended to help you make the actions you want them to make available and taken more often. CRO is the art of getting a higher percentage of website visitors to convert into customers or take any desired action on a web page.</p>

                <h2 id="whichTeamForWhichFunction">Which team for which function?</h2>
                <p>Often you see CRO being part of the (online) marketing team until it grows its own team. UX is part of the product team.</p>
           
                <h3>Why CRO is part of Marketing?</h3>
                <p>Since CRO is result/KPI driven and can have a direct impact on the business goals it’s part of the marketing team.</p>

                <h3>Why UX is part of the Scrum team?</h3>
                <p>UX is driven to optimize the product as well as possible. Scrum is about making products that are valuable to end-users. The Scrum team doesn’t build features nobody is going to use. The Scrum team evaluates their work daily and improve daily.</p>
            </div>

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>CRO & UX have similar skills. But they also require a very different set of skills that are key to perform in these positions.</p> 
                <p>Both of them are incredibly interesting if you are in any way helping a website to be more effective online, and both generally require original research and testing, and that is why the practitioners of these disciplines can become incrementally more effective outside of individual tests in the other websites they design.</p>
                <p>Studying and implementing tests around these disciplines helps provide a system for becoming a better web designer, not just in aesthetic preferences, but in an objective way. Not ‘I feel‘ this design decision will be more effective, but this design decision is more effective according to the numbers.</p>
                <p>Even though UI/UX experience and CRO are both centred around user behaviour and user interface, they are aimed to achieve different results.</p>
